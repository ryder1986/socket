linux-ftpd (0.17-31) unstable; urgency=low

  The recent IPv6 capability is handled in distinct ways
  by the three usual super-servers: openbsd-inetd, xinetd,
  and inetutils-inetd. The differences are discussed in the
  file README.Debian.

  Depending on your old setup, 'update-inetd' might complain
  about multiple instances of 'ftp' in '/etc/inetd.conf'. 
  The present version tries to counter-act this at future
  upgrades by inserting '--multi' in the maintainer scripts.

linux-ftpd (0.17-30) unstable; urgency=low

  This packaging of linux-ftpd incorporates working support
  for the IPv6 address family, in stand alone mode, as well
  as under the control of a super server like xinetd.

  The records made in wtmp now include the caller's address
  structure, thus improving the prospects of tracing clients.
